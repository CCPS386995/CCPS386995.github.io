        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am currently working to become a vet. In my personal life I try to learn more about animals. In my professional life I am currently in school and I am working hard to get good grades in order to do duel enrollment in 11th grade.I am working towards these goals by doing my work and studying in order to pass my tests. I will start volunteering at a vet office or at an animal shelter to get my  volunteering hours and to work with animals so I can get some experience. I will try to get the scores I need on state tests in order to move on.My values are to work hard and to make sure I am doing my work correctly. I am willing to study for at least an hour a day. This will ensure that I will be able to pass my tests.  One of my short-term goals is to continue getting A's and B's in school. I believe I can achieve this if I continue doing my work and turning it in on time. If I continue passing my tests then I will be able to keep this. I want to be known for my kindness and for being loyal. In middle school I earned many awards for my hard work including the "Principal's Award". In my free time I do horse back riding and choir.</p>
